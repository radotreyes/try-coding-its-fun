In this series, we'll be inspecting some web apps and components that you probably see everywhere, but maybe never really looked into. This time we'll be finding out how HTML5 video players work with an interactive example!<!-- end -->

## This is new, what's going on here?

Quick, name five methods on the HTML5 `video` tag! ...

...because if you just did so without a hitch, you're in a better spot than I was a week ago.

Welcome to a new series! In _Under the Hood_, we're going to be taking a look at the code behind the components, features, and applications that you probably see everywhere on the internet, yet you've never stopped and wondered how they work.

The goal here is to make it a little more inviting to dive into these web components yourself!

<!-- Over the course of my career, I've found that the biggest limiter to my productivity as a developer is not knowing what exactly I'm working on. Writing my first API call (in jQuery!), for example, wasn't particularly fun, and the fact that I didn't know what I was doing gave me some mild anxiety: **_Something_ is working here, but I don't know what.**

I was averse to working with external APIs until I actually pulled my big boy pants up and read the docs. Now -->
