You've heard some talk about this "web development" thing. Maybe you've been doing it for a while; maybe you haven't written a line of code in your life. Wherever you come from and whatever your situation, here's a reason to take the leap into web development: It's fun. You should try it.<!-- end -->

## Why web development? Why not something else?

Technology is taking us to really weird places right now. Entrepreneurs are sending their electric cars to space. Robots are verbally abusing others on Twitter. Cryptocurrency is (was?) all the hype this year.

If you're interested in software programming, you could possibly take your career in any of those directions and maybe become the next Elon Musk, but here I am recommending web development. Why would that be?

### If you have a computer, you can be a web developer

If you're a reader who happens to be new to coding, I want you to try this small exercise right now: Open up your browser's dev tools (On Chrome, that's **_Cmd+Shift+C_** or **_Ctrl+Shift+C_**). Go to your "Console" tab, and type this in:

```js
document.querySelector('#secret')
```

What a heartwarmer! If I were you, I'd open up Notepad and save that code as `findTheSecret.js`.

You just wrote a small web crawler script. If you weren't a web developer before, you just became one. Congrats! That wasn't hard at all!

The point I'm trying to make here is that **the barrier to entry with web development is really low**, and if you have the drive to do it, there's nothing stopping you. Of course, not everything in the web dev world is settled with one line of code. But, after going down this path, after a lot of experimentation and twice as many obstacles, you'll soon find that you're able to write little scripts like that any time you want, automate whatever you want, or maybe write an app about _whatever you want_.

### You can literally build anything

This is true of most software developer disciplines, and it's especially true for web development. I'd even argue that choosing the web as your platform takes care of most of the harder steps for you, like:

* Getting your computer set up to write code (All you need is a text editor, forget an IDE)
* Getting people to download your application (Is it hosted on a website? Probably! Who downloads websites?)
* Deploying your application (Used GitHub Pages? Netlify? Hell, think back to 2005... remember MySpace? It's really easy _still_ to get your application out there for all to see.)

And once you're past that, what you build is completely up to your imagination. Web apps can be anything from blogs like this one, to [animations of Moustached Nannies](https://codepen.io/miocene/pen/mjLPVp/), to large-scale networking applications like Twitter. Communities like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com), and [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) are full of projects that got their start just off the top of one developer's head, and can be really great inspiration for what's next for you!

### The community is fantastic and diverse

This may just be my observation, but web developers tend to come from every walk of life you can imagine, and we're all drawn to some aspect of the craft, whether it be the artistic possibilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or the sheer complexity of the code you can write for the web.

Go to a developer meetup; no doubt you'll find people who all enjoy getting their hands dirty with web technology. But one person might be raving about [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/), another complaining about how we don't have [decorators in JavaScript](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) yet, and the WASM dev across the room is is lecturing everyone else about how [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/) will be taking over the Internet in 2020.

You'll find that everyone is good at _something_. And if you reach out, that person who's good at _something_ will be happy to help you understand that _something_. **Everyone helps each other**. Web developers are overwhelmingly passionate about what they do, eager to share what they know, and if they're doing it right, they're eager to learn from you, too!

## Okay, but how do I _really_ start?

Maybe you already have an idea of what you want to write. But now you've got yourself thinking: **_Where do I begin?_**

I get it. Even if you're not actually brand new, the hard part with any project is _starting_, but that goes for anything you need to give effort towards. Feeling some anxiety about starting down a new path is normal. Nothing is laid out for you, you have to make decisions for youself----it's scary.

### Case #1: You're brand new. Try _freeCodeCamp_.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is an open-source educational website dedicated to helping learners write code for the web, along with offering developers the opportunity to help other nonprofit organizations. It's quite popular; check out [this Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7qpbgp/i_can_not_recommend_freecodecamp_more_how_the/) on the platform.

What you'll find almost instantly is a welcoming community of learners, ranging from novice developers who hadn't written code in their lives to experts trying to give back to the community. What you'll also find is an [enormous collection](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) of modules for helping you learn, starting from the [basics of HTML](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5) to [interview prep and algorithm challenges in JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/algorithms).

> My progress with freeCodeCamp. I am indeed a pleb.

What freeCodeCamp and many other learning projects like [Chingu](https://medium.com/chingu) and [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com) do is provide you with resources----a structured curriculum, an end goal, some projects to practice with, and most importantly, **a community of like-minded people** who you're sharing a learning experience with.

If you were worried that you were in this alone, and that it'd be hard to make much progress yourself... that's good news, isn't it? As a web developer, **you'll never have to worry about learning by yourself**, because there's always a community out there willing to help.

### Case #2: You've done all that. Where do you go now?

Great! You've gotten your hands dirty. You're looking for more. Have you tried looking into a framework yet? You've got plenty of options...

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
* [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/)
* Wait, what?

![A picture of a billion JavaScript frameworks](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*raWO3dhM4jMjf9VY-kZzNg.png)

> Too many options, maybe? cr. [Jose Aguinaga via HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f).

Chances are, you've heard some of those words, and the fact that you don't know is giving you some anxiety. It happened to me too. The best advice I can give you right now is to not worry about any of that and stay your course of learning. _Maybe_ pick one framework to learn, but just one (for now). Why?

**_Learning too many frameworks or libraries at once will only bog you down_**.

**_If you pick up five frameworks now, what happens when you have to code without one?_**

What's most important for you right now, and pretty much forever, is keeping up with your fundamentals. Scott Tolinski, who runs [Level Up Tutorials](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/), explains why during his [great talk at ZEIT Day 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK3BhwDRuL8).

(_To Framework, or Not To Framework?_ is actually quite a hot topic in web development right now, and it probably deserves its own post at the time of writing. I digress.)

As a beginner-intermediate developer, what's more important to you right now rather than looking for the best framework is figuring out how to self-direct your learning.

This is the point where I redirect you back to the beginning of the blog post, where I mentioned a bunch of things and resources that **should help you get excited about coding**, because that is actually the most important part here.

### Find things you _want_ to put to code!

Fortunately, finding things you're interested in is something you get to do yourself!

Reach out. Go to meetups. Drill into the minds of other developers. Get active on Twitter and join the conversation (I'm [@radotreyes](https://twitter.com/radotreyes/) btw, mash that follow button). In doing all this you get to explore the possibilities that web development has been giving you all along, and you'll realize that "dang it, Reuben was right with that cheesy blog post"!

But honestly, at this point you might still be looking for guidance. It's likely you're looking for ideas for your next project, or just something fresh to go at?

* [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) is a fantastic free course which has you build mini-apps using _Just JavaScript™️_, and will help you really understand what's going on behind the browser.
* [Just Build Websites](https://github.com/melanierichards/just-build-websites) by [Melanie Richards](https://www.melanie-richards.com/) is an enormous list of ideas for you to take on for your next project! I've actually been using this as a resource, and I can't recommend it enough.
* [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) is the biggest meetup-focused social network out there right now, and thousands of developer meetups are hosted through it. I can't how important it is to go to your local meetup group and absorb everything!
* Look into open-source projects on GitHub; maybe even start one! You get to put yourself in a decision-making position where you've got a team dependent on you----a huge stepping stone for many developers.

## Are you having fun yet?

This post is here to share my perspective on web development, and why I think you'll love it. If you were lost and looking for help: well, I hope I could help you find some direction. I'd like to stress one last thing one more time: **Focus on what makes you excited**. Don't write code just so you fit in somebody else's puzzle piece. Write the code that you want to write!

But yeah, seriously, try web development. It's pretty fun.
